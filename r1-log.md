I didn't keep track of my time today but I know I went over an hour. Currently, I am learning Python and trying to get through the day 1 lesson and project, but its already 1:30 am. Today, I worked on a skillcrush lesson and i am a lesson closer to being done with my unplug retreat project. I also worked on a tribute page for freecodecamp, using Cecily Tyson as my topic.
